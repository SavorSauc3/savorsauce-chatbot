# About SavorSauce Chatbot
I built this project because I was dissatisfied with many open source aternatives to ChatGPT. Many of them just shove all of the technical things in your face, which may be fine for many people, but I found to be visually displeasing. The other more visually pleasing alternatives made it difficult to edit parameters. This project is more of a middle ground, where the main window is more visually pleasing, while the technical details are not out of reach, and can be easily accessed through various means *Such as the settings panel*.

# Setup
- If cloning the repository, you will need to open two terminal windows. First navigate to chatbot-backend directory and type "python main.py" to start up the backend
- Next, use the second terminal window to navigate to chatbot-backend, type "npm start" to open the frontend in the browser

# Roadmap
- **Executable Electron Application**: No need to use any command line, or know and technical details!
- **Enhanced Search Abilitites** to bypass the llm knowledge cutoff, and recieve more useful information the AI was untrained on
- **Advanced Mathematical Computational Ability** using LaTeX to process difficult mathematical equations
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** so that the LLM can really get to know you, and your data

# Security
- **Your data is entirely private**: This codebase is entirely decentralized, and none of your data will be sent to any private servers to be sold off.
